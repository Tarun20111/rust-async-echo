## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- **Simple Interface**: The program‚Äôs design prioritizes user-friendliness, making it approachable for everyone.
- **Real-Time Communication**: This program allows you to send messages and receive replies instantly.
- **Demo Mode**: Easily run a demo to see how the client-server communication works without additional setup.
- **Open Source**: Being an open-source project means you can view the source code and contribute if you wish.

## üìå Usage Example

Once you have the program running, it is straightforward to use:

1. **Start the Server**: Run the server program. It will wait for clients to connect.
2. **Connect a Client**: Open another instance of the application as a client. Input the server's address and port number.
3. **Send Messages**: Type a message in the client window and hit enter. The server will echo back your message.

This simple process will help you understand how data travels over a TCP connection.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, here are a few tips:

- **Check Your Network**: Make sure both the server and client are connected to the same network.
- **Firewall Settings**: Ensure your firewall is not blocking the application.
- **Run As Administrator**: On Windows, try running the application as an administrator.
